<h1> Welcome to my Web Page </h1>

<h2> Avin Benny </h2>

<p class='paragraph'> Hello! My name is Avin, and I am a senior in the Pace nursing program. I was inspired to pursue a degree in nursing after watching and participating in the care my grandfather received after he was in a car accident leaving him paralyzed from the waist down. Furthermore, I have been intrigued with nonprofit organizations, ever since one of my church youth leaders started one called Lumen Vitae, which serves children in Haiti through sponsoring education. I want to learn skills within the realm of website design so that I can serve those in need in my own capacity! </p>
